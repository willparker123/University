/* This is a library module supporting lists. A list stores any number of items
and has a current position, which ranges from before the first item to after the
last item. Every operation is constant time.

The items stored in a list are of type 'item'. The typedef for this can be
changed for any particular application so that 'item' stands for any desired
type, e.g. a raw type such as int, double, char[20], struct... or a pointer type
such as char *, struct...*.

The functions with names ending in F are for forward traversal through a list,
and the ones ending in B are for backward traversal. The two sets of functions
are mirror images of each other. A typical forward traversal has the form:

    for (startF(l); ! endF(l); nextF(l)) {
        item x = getF(l);
        ...
    }

The lists provided by this module are not thread safe. */
